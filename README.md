# javaProjects
A bunch of code that I've written during High School. Most of which are solutions to various problems or problem sets.

The folders that start with r#Pr# (ex. r2Pr2) are all solutions that my team came up with during the ECOO competition for 2017.

The Waterloo folders are all my solutions to the Waterloo Programming Competition for 2017. (I have not solved all of these as of this date 9/19/2017)
